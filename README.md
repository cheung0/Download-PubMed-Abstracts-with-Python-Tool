## More Info
For example, I want to know more about Creatine Monohydrate, which is a supplement that increases muscle performance in resistance exercises, such as weightlifting, sprinting and bicycling. The problem is that I do not want to open 532 tabs or windows! Reading the abstract, or summary of a research paper, is a fast way to know if I should continue reading the paper. This tool solves this problem since it downloads all the abstracts in one text file. 

What's amazing about this tool is that you don't need to download anything or have any coding experience. Simply open the Google Colab file, change the query and its parameters, and run the code in your browser.
