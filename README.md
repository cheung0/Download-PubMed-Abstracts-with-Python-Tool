# Download-PubMed-Abstracts-with-Python-Tool

If you're a medical student, or doctor, or are trying to read PubMed articles relating to your medicine or medical condition, this Python tool's for you. It downloads PubMed abstracts in a text file, allowing you to read them faster. It helps you save time!

For example, I want to know more about Creatine Monohydrate, which is "a supplement that increases muscle performance in short-duration, high-intensity resistance exercises, such as weightlifting, sprinting and bicycling." The problem is that I do not want to open 532 tabs or windows! Reading the abstract, or summary of a research paper, is a fast way to know if I should continue reading the paper. This tool solves this problem since it downloads all the abstracts in one text file.
